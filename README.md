## ü§î Why?

### Easy to use

Designed to be easy for less advanced players! These shouldn't be hard, so we try and ease the setup needed.

### Free and open source

Anyone can view, modify and redistribute the source code. If you have privacy concerns or curiosity, you can ensure yourself that the code is not doing anything malicious.

### Active development

Suggested features are always being considered and sometimes added.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

To use it you need to have [NodeJS 16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.0/) installed.

**The version may contain bugs, as it's not fully released!**

## üìù Building from Source

Clone the repository on your machine using

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HybrisMC/HybrProxy
```

Once the repo is downloaded move to the directory and install the dependencies

```bash
$ cd HybrProxy
$ npm install
```

You can now build the project, you will be able to use the exe file located in the `dist` folder. Or use the `npm start` command to directly run the compiled TypeScript

```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

At the root of the project (or in the same directory as the executable) create a `config.jsonc` file with the following content:

```jsonc
{
// To get an API key, head to https://developer.hypixel.net/ and log in with your Hypixel Forums Account.
// (NOTE: You need to create an app on the website. After that, you can click create API key and enter that here)
  "apiKey": "API KEY HERE",
  "server": {
    // Change this to the server you are trying to connect, by default it will be set as hypixel.
    // (NOTE: Most other servers will not work)
    "host": "hypixel.net",
    "port": 25565
  },
  "dashboard": {
    // Whether to enable the app-dashboard for HybrProxy.
    "enabled": true
  },
  "proxyPort": 25556, // The port for the proxy, you can connect using "localhost:PORT" as the Server IP
  "customEmotes": {
    // Custom emojis you can add, you can use any symbols minecraft chat supports.
    // Reference: https://justpaste.it/8mnld
    ":solar:": "‚òÄ",
    ":lunar:": "‚òæ"
  },
  "checkForUpdates": true, // Whether to automatically check for updates and inform you if there are any.
  "autoDownloadUpdates": true, // Whether to automatically download new updates.
  "statistics": true, // Whether to track statistics about how you use hybris (launches, online usage, etc.).
  "modules": {},

}
```

```bash
$ npm start
```
